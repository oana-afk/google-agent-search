This suggests that a new example or demonstration of the `CalcInput` function is being added.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1.  **Clarity:** Since this is a \"chore\" to add an example, it would be helpful to add a comment explaining the purpose of this new line. For example:\n\n    ```go\n    // Demonstrate the usage of CalcInput function\n    cost.CalcInput(text, string(fineTuningData))\n    ```\n\n2.  **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling around the `CalcInput` function call, similar to the `CalcTrainning` function call. This would make the example more robust.\n\n    ```go\n    inputCost, err := cost.CalcInput(text, string(fineTuningData))\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Error calculating input cost:\", err)\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"Input cost:\", inputCost)\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **Output:** It would be beneficial to print the result of `CalcInput` to the console so that the example is more informative.\n\n    ```go\n    inputCost, err := cost.CalcInput(text, string(fineTuningData))\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Error calculating input cost:\", err)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(\"Input cost:\", inputCost)\n    ```\n\n4.  **Testability:** While this is just an example in `main.go`, consider adding a unit test for the `CalcInput` function to ensure it works as expected.\n\nDo you need anything else?\n"

Since the pull request only modifies one file, main.go, and the description indicates it's adding a demonstration, I would suggest the following:\n\n1.  **Review the implementation of the `CalcInput` example:** Ensure that the example is clear, concise, and easy to understand. It should effectively demonstrate the intended use of the function.\n2.  **Check for error handling:** Verify that the example includes proper error handling, if applicable. This will help users understand how to handle potential errors when using the function.\n3.  **Add comments:** Include comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the example. This will make it easier for others to understand the code.\n4.  **Consider adding a unit test:** Although it's just a demonstration, adding a simple unit test can help ensure that the example works as expected and prevent regressions in the future.\n\nExample of improvement:\n\n```go\n// This example demonstrates how to use the CalcInput function.\nfunc main() {\n    // Example input\n    input := \"some input string\"\n\n    // Calculate the result\n    result, err := CalcInput(input)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    // Print the result\n    fmt.Println(\"Result:\", result)\n}\n```\n\nDo you need anything else?\n"
